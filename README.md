schwancr_bin
============

Collection of scripts that I have made over my grad school career.

These are not really meant to be production quality... I wrote each one to accomplish a very specific task...

Notes:
1) To compile the cython code in pyschwancr, do:

    $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace
